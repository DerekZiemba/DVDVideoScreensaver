# DVDVideoScreensaver
Joke for reddit. DVDVideo logo only hits corners and changes colors. 
How to use:
* Click to switch modes between normal mode, always hit opposite corner, and always hit a corner.
  *  Always hit a corner mode is intended to hit all corners by randomly selecting one then making an arc to that corner if it's not directly opposite.   However, I haven't actually bothered to implement it yet so it will do nothing right now. 
* Press Enter to toggle full screen mode.
